# Forecasting Unemployment in Brazil

This project aims to forecast Brazil's unemployment rate using time series models, including traditional statistical methods (like ARIMA) and deep learning techniques (such as LSTM neural networks). Inspired by real-world forecasting challenges and economic insights.

## Objectives

- Collect and clean monthly unemployment data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Compare ARIMA and LSTM models
- Evaluate model performance (MAE, RMSE, etc.)
- Visualize forecasts vs. real values

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with code and visualizations
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling
- `reports/`: Generated plots and insights

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forecast-unemployment-brazil.git
cd forecast-unemployment-brazil
pip install -r requirements.txt
